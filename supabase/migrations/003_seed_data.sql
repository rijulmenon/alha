        E'# A Grand Wedding at the Ritz\n\nWhen the Al-Rashidi family approached us six months before their daughter''s wedding, they had one request: create something unforgettable.\n\n## The Challenge\n\nEight hundred guests. A twelve-metre dessert table. And a timeline that would make most pastry chefs nervous.\n\n## Our Approach\n\nWe started with a tasting session that lasted four hours. The family wanted traditional Middle Eastern flavors elevated with French technique. We delivered:\n\n- Six-tier croquembouche infused with saffron and cardamom\n- 1,200 gold-dusted macarons in rose, pistachio, and date flavors\n- Individual kunafa cups with clotted cream\n- Miniature baklava towers\n\n## The Result\n\nThe dessert table became the centerpiece of the evening. Guests couldn''t stop photographing it. The bride''s mother cried when she saw it. And we received five new wedding bookings that night.\n\nThis is why we do what we do.',
